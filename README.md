### Changelog

#### 0.10.0 (dev)

 - Preliminary support for Protocol Buffers via a single connection.
 - Fetch siblings by default, restoring previous riak-js behavior
 - Populate meta.links when saving an object based on the response's HTTP
   headers (github.com/accelerated)
 - Fix content length override. Allows handing in streaming data from e.g.
   connect.js. (github.com/englercj)
 - Only set the language attribute on map and reduce phases. Avoid setting it on
   phases where it's not according to spec. (github.com/accelerated)

#### 0.9.3
  
 - Switch testing framework to mocha/should.js (github.com/kenperkins)
 - Remove requirement of a Unix system from package.json (github.com/yawnt)
 - Fix a global leak of HttpSearchMeta (github.com/brianedgerton)

#### 0.9.2

 - Fix Search options so it handles hostname and port (github.com/kenperkins)
 - Fix unwanted vector clock overwriting during link walking (github.com/TauZero)
 - Handle connection errors gracefully so that they don't kill the process

#### 0.9.1

 - Request instrumentation for metrics, logging, etc.
 - Fix a leak in Httpmeta (github.com/rkusa), (#134)
 - Handle content length properly for Unicode data (#132)
 - Fix MapReduce options so it handles hostname and port (github.com/spencergibb)
 - Add support for link-walking (github.com/TauZero) 
 - Handle JSONified error messages (github.com/spencergibb)
 - Fix parsing of links on get requests (github.com/TauZero)

#### 0.9.0

 - Complete rewrite in JavaScript (two reasons: better debugging in production deployments, and more people can contribute)
 - Support Riak 1.0 features
 - First class support for streams (Luwak, key listing, Map/Reduce, logging)
 - Faster testing with node-seq + assert
 - Extra HTTP headers can now be passed in via `headers` (for instance custom usermeta, `X-Riak-Meta-*`) - these *will* override whatever has been set elsewhere
 - `addSearch` is now `search`
 - The project is open for other implementations
 - Removed Protocol Buffers support â€“ contributions welcome (extend `Client` in a file called `protobuf-client.js` along with a `protobuf-meta.js`)
 - A client-side impl is also possible (look at https://github.com/ded/reqwest)
 - Support for Riak Search, including adding and removing documents directly.
   Search is namespaced on the client separately: `riak.search.find('users',
   'email:test@example.com')`
 - Moved MapReduce to a separate namespace on the client to separate concerns in
   a nicer way: `riak.mapreduce.add('users').run()`

##### TODO

 - Unify `meta` in all responses (check `getAll`, chunked map/reduce) - meta should allow for fine-grained mappings
 - SSL support
 - Use path internally but don't expose it as API (see `path` branch), to prepare for new URIs in Riak 1.0
 - More rigorous test suite (port from master)

##### LATER
 - Integrate test backend
 
#### 0.4.1

 - Add search params [gpascale]
 - SSL client [isaacs]
 - Last-modified date patch [siculars]
 - Add `meta.noError404` so that you can prevent 404s from showing up as errors [syrio]
 - Deprecation warnings

#### 0.4.0

 - `db.update`: convenience method for updating documents
 - Changed debug behaviour: always log to stdout. Not providing a callback **will** output to `console.log` regardless of the setting

#### 0.4.0rc3

 - Allow headers to override, useful for reverse proxies sitting between node and Riak
 - URI-encoding bucket/key is now an option (encodeUri)
 - Add documentation for map/reduce arguments
 - Remove agent from meta, which should fix critical bug (#64, #67)
 - Allow logging to alternate streams. And default to stderr, not stdout (thanks Mark!)
 - Add docs for host/port (thanks Ken!)
 - Add the new `presort` property for Riak Search (thanks Greg!)

#### 0.4.0rc2

 - Major docs update => [http://riak-js.org](http://riak-js.org)
 - `keys=stream` emits `keys` events
 - `walk` now accepts `noJSON`
 - Support Map/Reduce timeout option
 - Protobuf interface refactor (still experimental support in 0.4)
 - Minor bug fixes

#### 0.4.0rc1

 - node 0.4.x compatibility
 - npm 1.0 compatibility
 - Minor bug fixes

#### 0.3.6

 - Fix index.js and package.json for npm compat
 - Fix recursing usermeta
 - Fix for luwak location parsing
 - Updates related to Riak Search operations

#### 0.3.0beta6

 - Test backend implementation
 - Connect session store
 - Protobuf parsing is now more robust
 - Replace client every time ECONNREFUSED occurs
 - Initial Riak Search support
 - Minor bugfixing and internals refactoring

#### 0.3.0beta5

 - Add support for bucket listing in HTTP (new Riak 0.14 feature)
 - Updated to CoffeeScript 1.0.0
 - Fixed a memory leak caused by adding too many Event Listeners
 - If there's no `vclock` present in a Meta, do not send any `clientId`
